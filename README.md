# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## Assignment 1

 This assignment uses data from
 the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
 Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
 datasets. "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set"
 data is used in particular.
 
 Please note that each of the attached four R files
 have a block of code on top that basically preps and loads the data.
 This has been done so that each R file can be run on its own.
